1.  Attempting to modify a borrowed value (crashed)
```
fn main() {
    let a : i32 = 2;
    let b : &i32 = &a;
    *b = 3;
}
```
2. Right mutable borrow
```
fn main() {
    let a : i32 = 2;
    let b : &mut i32 = &mut a;
    *b = 3;
}
```

3. Multiple mutable borrow (crashed)
```
fn main() {
	let a : i32 = 2;
	let r1 : &mut i32 = &mut a;
	let r2 : &mut i32 = &mut a;
}
```
4. Multiple mutable borrow in different scope
```
fn main() {
	let a : i32 = 2;
	
	{
		let r1 : &mut i32 = &mut a;
	}

	let r2 : &mut i32 = &mut a;
}
```
5. combining mutable and immutable references(crashed)
```
fn main() {
	let a : i32 = 2;
	let r1 : &i32 = &a;
	let r2 : &mut i32 = &mut a;
	println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
}
```
// supposed error message
```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `a` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
```
6. combining mutable and immutable references
```
fn main() {
	let a : i32 = 2;
	let r1 : &i32 = &a;
	let r2 : &i32 = &a;
	println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
	let r3 : &mut i32 = &mut a; 
	println!("{}", r3);
}
```
7. dangling reference(crashed)
```
fn main() {

    let reference_to_nothing : &i32 = dangle();

}
fn dangle() -> &i32 {
    let a : i32 = 2;
    &a
}
```
8. no dangling reference
```
fn main() {
    let b : i32 = no_dangle();
}
fn no_dangle() -> i32 {
    let a : i32 = 2;
    a
}
```
9. classic borrow check
10. disjoint origins cannot affect each other
11. A little complicated reference to reference. An assignment to a
    dereference does not kill the lifetime of the local variable
12. Test alias graph: copy and modified from
    `assign_deref_weak_update.rs`. The key point is that *x indirectly
    changes p so that tmp and *p alias. It test the functionality of
    alias graph.
13. A normal re-borrow test
14. A test that is not compiled in NLL but can be compiled Polonius
15. Borrow from a box and move that box
16. Test if statement
17. Test loop
18. Use after free error
19. test share reference
20. Polonius example from [https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2023/09/29/polonius-part-2/]
21. Generic origin in struct and enum
22. Return dangling pointer
23. Problem case #4 from NLL RFC
